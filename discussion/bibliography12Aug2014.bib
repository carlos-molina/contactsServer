              Binding explained:
              These forms of expression all involve the idea of binding
              an identifier to a denotation; the corresponding constructions
              in programming languages are the various forms of local
              declarations, including local variables, function definitions,
              formal parameter lists, iteration control variables, and so on.
              Because of binding constructions, it is necessary in general
              to evaluate an expression relative to an *environment* which
              provides a value for each free variable in the expression. 
              This article made me think of the binding of variables
              in mathematics. In an algebraic expression, the variables
              x,y,z... are bound to some values an assumed that those
              values never change during the evaluation time which
              might be arbitrarily decided by the user and can be
              as small or large as necessary. The binding is explicitely
              assumed but I havent seen it explicitly discussed by
              authors of algebra books!"}

               generally, functional programs contain no side-effects 
               at all. 
               since no sideeffect can change an expression's value, 
               it can be evaluated at any time. This
               relieves the programmer of the burden of prescribing 
               the flow of control. 
               Since expressions can be evaluated at any time, one can 
               freely replace variables by their values and vice versa:
               programs are referentially transparent.
               This freedom helps make functional programs more tractable 
               mathematically than their conventional counterparts.
               The power of a prog. language comes from the features it
               provides for modularization. 
               ... functional languages provide two new, very important 
               kinds of glue... This is the key to functional 
               programming's power---it allows improved modularization.
               Languages that aim to improve productivity must support 
               modular programming well. But new scope rules and mechanisms 
               for separate compilation are not enough --modularity means 
               more than modules.
               To support modular programming, a language must provide 
               good glue. Functional programming languages provide two new 
               kinds of glue --higher-order functions and lazy evaluation."}

             In Emerald, the relationship between an object and the
             abstract type(s) that it implements is one of shared
             interface. An object supports a superset of the operations
             defined by its abstract types and each the supported
             operations must conform to the corresponding operations
             in the abstract types.
             Delegation explained:

             Why is desirable to hide distribution:
              The tendency of many distributed systems is to hide
              distribution from the programmer. For example, in Xerox
              RPC [5], remote procedure calls were added to Cedar
              Mesa. Remote procedure calls
              were designed to be semantically identical to local
              procedure calls. This is obviously a desirable property and
              is what makes RPC so attractive; programs can be written
              and debugged on a single node using local procedures and
              then easily distributed.

              Trasparency: While it is crucial that invocation be location
              independent, it is not necessary that an object's location be
              invisible. Many applications may choose to ignore
              distribution, but others may wish to benefit from location
              dependence."}

  @comments= "Data Abstractions also simplify the structure of programs that use 
              them because they present a higher level interface. For example, they 
              reduce the number of arguments to procedures
              because abstract objects are communicated instead of their representations. 
              Object-oriented programming is primarily a data abstraction technique, and 
              much of its power derives from this. However, it elaborates this technique 
              with the notion of inheritance.
              The first programming abstraction mechanism was the procedure: performs 
              some task or function; other parts of the program call the procedure to 
              accomplish the task.  To use the procedure, a programmer cares only about what 
              it does and not how it is implemented.
              Data abstractions provide the same benefits as procedures, but for data!
              Thus a data abstraction is a set of objects that can be manipulated directly only by a set of
              operations. An example of a data abstraction is the integers: the objects are 1, 2, 3, 
              and so on and there are operations to add two integers, to test them for equality, and 
              so on. Programs using integers manipulate them by their operations, and are shielded from 
              implementation details such as whether the representation is 2's complement. 
              An implementation is correct if it provides the behavior defined by
              the specification. Correctness can be proved mathematically if the specification is 
              written in a language with precise semantics; otherwise we establish correctness by 
              informal reasoning or by the somewhat unsatisfactory technique of testing.
              In languages with inheritance, a data abstraction implementation (i.e., a class) has two
              kinds of users. There are the outsiders who simply use the objects by calling the 
              operations. But in addition there are the insiders. These are the subclasses, which are 
              typically permitted to violate encapsulation. "}

               Its syntax and type system are similar to Haskell. 
               The idea is to use type for expressing and enforcing
               correctness properties.
               Types have also been used to model information to ensure
               security properties of systems. Types have been used to 
               track resource control, such as the possibility of 
               non--termination, or to place upper bounds on the time consumed 
               by a computation.
               An example is is sequences of elements with the semantic
               property that the length of the sequence is encoded in 
               its type. For example the sequence (a1,a2,a3) has type 
               (Seq a 3). A language can express and enforce  a
               communmication protocol (open file->read file->, ... 
               ->read file, close file) 
                protocols quite naturally using its type system
                There is no translation between programming notation to
                some external reasoning tool. We can save the power and 
                frustration of using a theorem prover for when we really 
                need it."}

             Asymmetric vs Symmetric ciphers: Asymmetric offer more security functionality and

             Symmetric ciphers serve mainly for message integrity checks, entity authentication,

             hardware and software. 
             For example, an optimized asymmetric algorithm such as elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) performs 100 to
             1,000 times more slowly than a standard symmetric cipher such as the Advanced Encryption Standard
             (AES) algorithm, which correlates with a two-to-three- orders-of-magnitude higher power consumption.  "}

               such as RSA. A shorter key implies easier data management, lower 
               hardware requirements (in terms of buffers, memory, data storage, etc.), 
               less bandwidth when transmitting the keys over a network, 
               and longer battery life in devices where it is important, 
               such as mobile phones.  
               FIPS 186-2 describes all the algorithms and digital
               signature schemes that can be used by any agency of the U.S. 
               Both FIPS 186-2 and ANSI X9.62 state a minimum key size of 
               1024 bits for RSA and DSA and 160 bits for ECC. "}

              Fundamentals:
              a) Packet capturing is passive—it doesn't transmit or alter network traffic.
              b) You can capture only the packets that your system receives. On a typical 
                 switched network, that excludes unicast traffic between other hosts 
                 (packets not sent to or from your machine).
              c) You can capture only packets addressed to your system, unless the network 
                 interface is in promiscuous mode.  
              d) It uses command line instructions:
                 $tcpdump -i eth1 -vvn icmp or udp
                 Typical output arp who-has 10.0.0.1 tell 10.0.0.2 arp reply 10.0.0.1 is-at 00:01:02:03:04:05 
              e) tcpdump also is an incredible learning tool. There is no better way to learn 
                 how networks and protocols work than from watching their actual packets.

               routers and proxy servers. A screening router is a multiported IP router 
              that applies a set of rules to each incoming IP packet.
              A proxy server is a server process running on a firewall system to perform a specific 
              TCP/IP function as a proxy on behalf of the network users. A proxy server is, in essence, 
              an application-layer gateway---a gateway from one network to another for a
              specific network application. The user contacts a proxy using a TCP/IP application, 
              such as telnet or ftp, and the proxy server asks the user for the name of the remote 
              host to be accessed. 
              The advantage of the proxy is application level authentication of the
              user (typically name and pass) and in addition, logging and accounting. 
              The advantage of screening routers are
              simplicity but they do not provide user level authentication, they operate
              at IP packet level. "}

              type-safety.
              In C++, generic types are described by templates. For each
              specific usage of a template the C++ compiler generates a
              new type. Thus, at run time, the generated types are like
              regular types.
              Java supports genericity only at source code level,
              but not at the machine level. In other words, it does not
              generate types at all.

              are discovered based on XML configuration files.

                 A verification task specifies the object (source code files), the safety
                 property, and all parameters and results for one single invocation
                 of the model checking engine. Each verification task maintains a 
                 status (checked, safe, unsafe, unchecked, or changed)."}

              1) declaring access rights, each of which 
                 state that some user is allowed to perform 
                 some action on some object. 
              2)  each user request is intercepted by a *monitor* 
                  that decides on the basis of the declared access 
                  rights whether or not the request actually 
                  shall be executed.
              3) the distributed monitoring system assigns 
                 and withdraws dynamic access rights on a short 
                 term basis for just a single activity, thereby 
                 enforcing that only allowed sequences can 
                 actually occur.
              4) rights are granted and revoked.
              5) Example:
                 i) each such sequence starts by drafting a contract, 
                    followed by a careful inspection with an acceptance 
                    decision; 
                 ii) dependent on this decision: either the contract 
                    is confirmed and subsequently either it becomes 
                    valid based on a timely payment or it is rejected 
                    based on a missed payment deadline; 
                 iii) or the contract is immediately rejected. 
                 iv) While enforcing statedependent access control, for 
                     instance the activity contract rejection cannot 
                     occur as an isolated event, rather it is dynamically 
                     enabled only just after the pertinent event of 
                     missed deadline or negative inspection, respectively, 
                 v) and after an actual execution, the activity contract 
                    rejection is immediately blocked again. "}

               Compliance rules might be complex; they might include
               loops of activities. It seems that requirements expressed
               in LTL are not enough. The compliance might be actual business
               processes. 
               Business processes need to satisfy three classes of
               compliance rules: a) Regulations (SOX act), b) IT security
               standards c) quality standards.
               Compliance checking can be regarded as pattern matching and
               can be analysed based on graph theory or model checking.

               Different languages for modeling processes differ in the
               constructs they offer to include this information in the
               model of the process. Languages usually represent this
               information from four perspectives: functional,
               behavioral, organizational, informational. 
               So a given language is normally focused on one or more
               of these four perspectives.
               Some languages pose few requirements on the formalism
               of their models since their models are intended for
               communication (with other designers) rather tham for
               for rigorous analysis. Formality of the language: A formally
               precise language is enactable
               on a machine; whereas process scripts performed by humans

               The most prominent dimension for modelling

              new messages, to be sent to processes in the remote or local

             set of non-terminals that specify the overall structure of

             represent a correct program and tries to map it into
             a high level constructs (set of nonterminal symbols).

             an explicit set of primitive vocabulary,
             plus explicit grammar rules for combining this vocabulary to 
             form more complex expressions, as well as explicit inferencing

             Such a language can include imperative or declarative

             For ex. a predicate logic language: it is more like a

   @comments= "On p24: divisibility: questions of divisibility can be often be resolved
               by restricting school algebra to the set Z of integers. Because division
               is often impossible in Z, the arithmetic and algebra of integers is little
               different from that of rational numbers and real numbers.
               The central idea is that of divisibility. Despite its name, divisibility 
               depends only on multiplication--not on division. 
               If m and n are integers, we say that m divides n, exactly,
               if n= mk for some integer k:
                 - the integer m is called the factor of n.
                 - the integer n is called a multiple of m and 
                 - n is said to be divisible by m.
               The equation n=mk is a factorization of n as a product of two
               integers m and k. Thus factors come in pairs m and k=n/m.
               
               When told that n and m are integers and that m divides n it is not
               helpful to write a fraction such as n/m because it is haird to
               remember that the expression n/m that looks like a fraction
               is actually an integer.
               The information that an integer divides another integer should
               always be interpreted as an equation involving multiplication
               with integer factors--avoid fractions. So
               m divides n means n=mk for some integer k
               In this way, it is clear that all the symbols are integers and
               it is easy to reason in ways that simply dont work if you mix
               fractions with integers."}

              event for an action is often omitted, making it difficult to
              determine the execution of logical expressions. In
              addition, the deadline of an action or a task is often not
              stated. However, this is important for the enforcement of
              obligations; otherwise a party may defer the obliged
              action indefinitely. 
               In Lai Xu PhD Thesis: Monitoring Multiparty Contracts
               2004, Section 2.2.2 :deontic logics studies the nature 
               of obligation, which refers to whether an action is obligatory, 
               and not whether it occurs. Deontic logic is the study of the 
               logical relationships among propositions that assert that 
               certain actions or states of a affairs are morally obligatory, 
               morally permissible, morally right or morally wrong. "}

  @comments= "An integer greater than one is called a prime 
              number if its only positive divisors (factors) 
              are one and itself.  The first six primes 
              are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13. 
              The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic shows that the 
              primes are the building blocks of the positive integers: 
              every positive integer is a product of prime numbers 
              in one and only one way, except for the order of the 
              factors: the prime factors of an integer determines 
              its properties. 
              There is only one (unique!) set of prime factors for 
              any number.
              If you want to understand a building, how it will react 
              to weather or fire, you first need to know what it is 
              made of. The same is true for the integers--most of 
              their properties can be traced back to what they are 
              made of: their prime factors.",
